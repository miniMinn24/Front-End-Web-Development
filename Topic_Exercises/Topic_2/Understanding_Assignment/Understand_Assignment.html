		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p>
			You are tasked with creating a modern, responsive website for a boutique
			coffee shop that is expanding its presence online. The shop, Bean
			Boutique, has been successfully operating in a local neighbourhood and now
			aims to reach a wider audience by showcasing its unique coffee blends,
			brewing equipment, and coffee-related events online. The website should be
			visually appealing and user-friendly across various devices, setting the
			stage for future e-commerce capabilities.
		</p>

		<h3>Scenario</h3>
		<p>
			<i>Bean Boutique</i> has outlined several key requirements for their
			website to ensure it effectively represents their brand and offerings:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<b>Home Page:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						The main page should welcome visitors with enticing images of coffee
						beans, brewing equipment and people enjoying coffee. The aim is to
						evoke a sense of warmth and community.
					</li>
					<li>
						Use visuals prominently to minimise text clutter, enhancing the user
						experience with high-quality images and infographics.
					</li>
					<li>
						Include a navigation bar that features smooth hover effects, a
						slideshow of featured products and events, a well-structured header,
						informative sections, and a footer.
					</li>
					<li>
						Implement a modal popup window for first-time visitors, offering a
						discount on their first purchase in exchange for email signup.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Coffee Selection:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						This page will display a catalogue of the coffee shop's unique
						blends and single-origin coffees. Each listing should include a
						brief description, tasting notes, and recommended brewing methods.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Brewing Equipment:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Display a range of brewing equipment sold by the boutique, from

						A section dedicated to upcoming events and workshops, such as coffee
						tasting sessions, brewing classes, and meet-the-roaster events.
						Include a registration feature for users to sign up online.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Shopping Cart:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Allow visitors to add their favourite coffee blends and equipment to
						a shopping cart for future purchases. This feature should save user
						selections and offer an easy checkout process once online
						transactions are enabled.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>

			<li>
				<b>Special Offers and Subscriptions:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>
